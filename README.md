#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/2zbLzO6E6gM>

#### Description:
A command-line Python application that helps you **track expenses**, **categorize transactions**, and **analyze monthly budgets** using a CSV file of transactions.

This project is perfect for managing personal finances and looks great on a resume or portfolio. It was built following structured programming principles and includes unit tests using `pytest`.

  - Category breakdown

- ðŸ’µ **Budget Recommendations**
Provides simple, data-driven suggestions, such as:
  - Areas where you can cut back spending
  - Progress towards a target savings goal

Three core functions are fully tested:
  - `parse_transactions`
  - `categorize_transactions`
  - `monthly_summary`
